# Oxidized 1.19.1

**_Disclaimer: I am not the original creator of this mod, this is just a port of the original Fabric
mod [Oxidized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oxidized). The current intention with Oxidized Forge is to
be as close to a 1-to-1 port of the original mod as possible._**

***
**Oxidized aims to provide more uses for vanilla copper. Now that copper has been added to vanilla Minecraft,
there is a lot of potential for its uses. Since we didn't get much content in the base game I have put together this mod
to improve your copper experience. I tried my best to keep this Vanilla+ while also providing copper blocks/items for
different playstyles.**

### About:

_See images tab for more details_

**Copper Pulsar:** This item is an electromagnet inspired tool. While in the player's inventory, the pulsar will
allow you to pick up experience orbs and items from up to x10 farther than the normal pickup range. It can be toggled on
and off using right-click.

**Copper Rail:** The Copper Rail functions almost identical to the Powered Rail. The difference is that a chain of
connected copper rails can stay powered for up to 100 blocks as compared to 8 blocks with the Powered Rail.

**Vertical Cut Copper:** Vertical cut copper is a building block that is designed like a copper block with a line
through the middle. This is inspired off of the original cut copper design that was later changed in the full release.
Vertical cut copper can oxidize like normal copper but waxing it with a honey comb can stop this process.

**Copper Kiln:** The Copper Kiln is a new unique furnace type. This kiln can smelt cobblestone, clay, sand, and logs
at extremely fast speeds. The kiln is meant for obtaining terracotta, bricks, stone, charcoal and glass for building
quickly. It functions like the smoker and blast furnace.

**Copper Lantern:** Copper Lanterns are a new lantern type that emit a green flame. They can be crafted with 8 copper
nuggets around a single torch. Copper lanterns function the same as normal lanterns. (Copper nuggets are obtained by
putting a copper ingot in a crafting table)

**Rose Gold Tools:** Rose Gold is a new tool material that can be made in a smithing table. Rose gold does not have
an actual ingot as it is crafting with a gold tool and a copper ingot in a smithing table. Rose gold tools provide a
similar durability and mining level to Iron tools but they are as fast and enchantable as gold tools.

**Copper Pan:** The Copper Pan is a unique block that allows the player to passively pan for resources such as clay
and iron nuggets. The pan will only work if it is placed in water and on a sand or gravel block. Overtime the pan will
sift and release items it finds. The current loot pool includes: Iron Nugget (15%), Gold Nugget (15%), Sand (24%),
Emerald (2%), Gravel (12%), Clay Ball (32%). The speed at which the pan finds items is relative to the random tick
speed.

**Copper Golem:** The Copper Golem is a mob based off of the Minecraft Mob Vote 2021. It can be created by placing a
lightning rod on top of a copper or cut copper block. The golem will wander around and can press copper buttons nearby (
Copper Buttons have been added but not yet obtainable in survival). Copper Golems will oxidize over a long period of
time, but will walk towards lightning rods in thunderstorms, and will un-oxidize when struck.
